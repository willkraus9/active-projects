### Lecture 0: Intro / Scratch
 * action verbs = **Functions**
 * answer some question / fork = **Conditionals**
     * part which is being answered (true / false)= **Boolean Expresssions**
 * directive to do something over and over again = **Loops**
 * doing an action and putting out a result = **Algorithm**
    * Algorithms should be named what they do! 
    * For implementation across programs, abstract parameters for adaptability
    * stuff to put into algorithm = **Argument / Parameter / Input**
    * stuff take out of algorithm = **Return Values / Outputs**
* **NB:** *Evaluation (does it do the thing) + critique of code (how well is thing done) is good for reviewing!*

### Lecture 1: C 
* By the end of lec: write "correct" code (does thing + good design)
* **IDE** = Integrated Developer Environment (used to write code)
* **Compiler** = convert one language to another (human-facing code --> machine code)
* **Terminal** = see what computer interaction sees; runs commands on computer in command line interface 
* To run code: run in command line
    * "make _name of program in c_"
        * (now there is a file that is called that on computer)
        * (go into current folder) (run) _name of program_ --> ./_name of program_
* **GUI** = 'gooey' = Graphical User Interface
* Command Line Interface: Linux
    * rm = remove files
    * ls = list all files in folder
* **NB:** *have to compile each time when make changes!*
* in C: have functions, arguments
    * functions: _word_ (
    * arguments: add double quotes (for **string** of words)
        * also have to end with semicolon
    * Return values - get value use and reuse
        * in C: ans = get_string() (receives string in response to be assigned to "ans" function)
            * also have to tell what kind of variable the function will be stored as
    * All together: string answer = get_string("What is your name?");
* 
    string answer = get_string("What's Your Name?");
    printf("Hi there, %s!",answer);
    
* so to make the files, you have to open bash in the terminal (have the $ instead of PC) for stuff to work?
    * didn't get it to work when done at 5:10 on 5/30
### Lecture 2: Arrays 
### Lecture 3: Algorithms 
### Lecture 4: Memory 
### Lecture 5: Data Structures
### Lecture 6: Python
#### Roughly 4 hours per day!
* time is:  0:00:00 as of 5/30 ~1:29pm
* time is:  0:51:04 as of 5/30 2:50pm
* time is:  1:46:27 as of 5/30 3:24pm 
* time is:  2:06:50 as of 5/30 4:14pm (had to get compiler for C/C++ straight)
* time is:  2:43:33 as of 5/30 5:02pm (cs50 implementation problems)
* time is:  x:xx:xx as of x/xx x:xxyy
