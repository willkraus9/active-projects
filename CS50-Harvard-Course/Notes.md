### Lecture 0: Intro / Scratch
 * action verbs = **Functions**
 * answer some question / fork = **Conditionals**
     * part which is being answered (true / false)= **Boolean Expresssions**
 * directive to do something over and over again = **Loops**
 * doing an action and putting out a result = **Algorithm**
    * Algorithms should be named what they do! 
    * For implementation across programs, abstract parameters for adaptability
    * stuff to put into algorithm = **Argument / Parameter / Input**
    * stuff take out of algorithm = **Return Values / Outputs**
* **NB:** *Evaluation (does it do the thing) + critique of code (how well is thing done) is good for reviewing!*

### Lecture 1: C 
* By the end of lec: write "correct" code (does thing + good design)
* **IDE** = Integrated Developer Environment (used to write code)
* 

### Lecture 2: Arrays 
### Lecture 3: Algorithms 
### Lecture 4: Memory 
### Lecture 5: Data Structures
### Lecture 6: Python
